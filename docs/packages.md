# Application Packages

This tutorial provides two separate application packages:

- `training`  
- `inference`

Each application package has its own Docker image, which has been published to a dedicated GitHub Container Registry.

For more details on how each package works, refer to the documentation for [training](./training-container.md) and [inference](./inference-container.md).
