# Stage-in

To test the inference module, the user must first **stage in Sentinel-2 L1C data** from [Copernicus Data Space](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu).

This is done by running a Bash script that uses the `Stars` tool to download and prepare the data.  
For more information on how `Stars` works, refer to its [official documentation](https://github.com/Terradue/Stars).
